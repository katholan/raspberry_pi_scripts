# A repository for various Raspberry Pi scripts, for example taking photos or measuring humidity and temperature.

## Raspberry Pi Camera Timelapse

See [this tutorial](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-picamera) for starting information.

For this code, I am using the Python package [`PiCamera`](https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.13/index.html).

The file `camera.py` contains the code I used for taking pictures with the Raspberry Pi. Do NOT name your files after already existing scripts (eg `picamera.py`).
